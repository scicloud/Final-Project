Final Project
You are Santa in a typical 2D platformer. The game is supposed to revolve around the mechanic where certain boys and girls ("enemies")
want certain gifts/presents to be satisfied. If they are not satisfied they attack you or throw coal at you. This mechanic is a large part
of the game but was not implemented because I was super distracted by implementing UI because it was more fun than I thought.

Buttons: Z shoots presents, ESC opens pause menu, Left CTRL will open the Elf's message once it closes.
UI: Coins are located in the top right. A glass of milk is your health bar in the bottom left. Present ammunition is located in the bottom right.
